    title: "Call for Papers",
    description: "The TFGET 2026 team invites papers from students, teachers, scientists, and researchers in academia and industry to present the results of their research and development efforts in the field of thermal fluids and green, sustainable energy. Papers must report original academic or industrial research in any of the following topics, not limited to, but relevant to the conference. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality, presentation, and relevance through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers."
