              Manuscript preparation and author guidelines

              Listed below are the official requirements for preparing and submitting a manuscript to TFGET26. Failure to abide by any of the following requirements may result in desk rejection of the manuscript:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
              <li>
                <strong>Manuscript template:</strong> Electronic submission of papers in searchable PDF or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvvs482sqVoc9NvL89kO5g85aNZPlJst/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105866154767121096099&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-conf-green-600 hover:text-conf-green-700 underline">Microsoft Word formats</a> is required. The maximum length of a manuscript is eight pages, including text, figures, and tables, plus an additional two pages for references. Changes to the templates are not allowed. Desk rejection will occur automatically if the manuscript format is not followed, including if the margins or vertical spacing are altered. The program chairs retain the right to ask for the original Word document in order to assess any submission's possible non-compliance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Author Information:</strong> A complete list of co-authors must be included in the submission form as part of the full paper submission process in order to prevent conflicts of interest between authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs. Once submitted, the author list cannot be changed. Anyone who has been directly or indirectly associated with the manuscript at any point during the decision-making process—whether as a reviewer or as a member of the organizing committee—should not be retroactively added as a co-author.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Disclosure and acknowledgement of data use:</strong> The origin, license, and (if applicable) ethical application number of any public or private data utilized in the paper's preparation must be disclosed by the authors. As instructed by the publishers of any public or private data utilized in the development of the article, the publication should additionally include citation information and/or acknowledgments. Anonymization of the data use declaration and acknowledgment is required for evaluation, if appropriate. Anywhere in the main text, such as when describing the experimental setup, the data use declaration can be included.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Participation at conferences:</strong> An author who has registered for the conference must present all accepted papers, either online or offline. Authors must request a waiver from the TFGET26 program committee in the event that an emergency prevents them from participating. If the authors do not present their material in offline or online mode, the program committee retains the power to remove an approved paper from the proceedings.
              </li>

              Submission & Review Process
            </h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Microsoft Conference Management Tool (CMT) will be used for all abstract and paper submissions [<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/author/author-submission-form.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-conf-green-600 hover:text-conf-green-700 underline">click here for how to submit</a>]. Submissions to TFGET26 will typically be reviewed by two to three reviewers. Some crucial components to help authors have a seamless submission and review process are listed below.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Submission to Track and Themes:</strong> Every paper needs to be submitted using the Conference Track and Secondary, with areas chosen from the CMT system under that Track. Any other secondary regions can be chosen as needed. The CMT system will use these subjects to suggest Area Chair assignments and reviewers. More thorough topic selections will generally result in better reviewers.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>BioRxiv/arXiv:</strong> The authors of a submitted paper may occasionally be known to a reviewer due to the growing popularity of posting technical reports and arXiv papers (or other types of preprints). It is highly discouraged for reviewers to look through arXiv for submissions they have been tasked with reviewing. Even if they happen to stumble upon this knowledge, they are disinclined to use it while creating their evaluation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Duplicate Submissions:</strong> Submissions for TFGET26 must be unique and cannot be published or considered for publication elsewhere. The authors of a full paper submitted to TFGET-26 agree that their work has not been published before, has not been accepted for publication, and is not being considered for publication in a substantially identical form in any peer-reviewed journal, conference, or workshop. Desk rejection will occur automatically if any of these requirements are broken. To have innovative new material published for the first time at TFGET26 is the aim of the dual submission policy.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Plagiarism:</strong> Plagiarism is a serious offense that involves using someone else's words or findings without giving them credit or providing the necessary citations. Reusing figures and text passages from the writers' own earlier works is an example of self-plagiarism, which is likewise prohibited. Such plagiarism can be identified by reviewers and chairs, who are asked to report it to the TFGET26 Organizing Committee for investigation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Conflicts of interest:</strong> In a community as interconnected as ours, conflicts of interest are unavoidable. It is essential that the authors include a comprehensive list of co-authors at the time of submission in order to resolve such disputes. Once submitted, the author list cannot be changed. Any change to the author list must be justified in writing to the committee, unless there are exceptional circumstances that warrant it. Anyone who has been directly or indirectly involved with the manuscript at any point during the decision-making process—as a reviewer, an area chair, or a member of the organizing committee—should never be included as a co-author.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              <strong>The application of LLMs (large language models):</strong> LLMs, like ChatGPT, are permitted to be used as a general-purpose writing aid. Authors should be aware that they are solely accountable for the information in their articles, including information produced by LLMs that can be seen as scientific misconduct or plagiarism (e.g., falsification of facts). LLMs cannot be considered authors.
